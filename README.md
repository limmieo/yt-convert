- 📝 **Overlays smart captions** from `.txt` files with fade + bounce
- 📽️ **Appends branded outro clips** (for select brands)
- 🔄 **Randomizes watermark opacity, size, and animation path**
- 🧩 **Supports multi-brand workflows** from a single backend
- 🔗 **Integrates with Make.com, Google Sheets, Dropbox, and Meta API**

### 🎬 Editing Pipeline
